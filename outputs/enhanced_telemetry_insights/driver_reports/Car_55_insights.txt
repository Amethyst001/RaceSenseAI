INSIGHTS BY PRIORITY
================================================================================


================================================================================
HIGH PRIORITY (10 insights)
================================================================================

1. [Threshold Braking Development]
   Issue: Peak brake pressure of 7.3% is below GR86 threshold capability (90%+ with race ABS and Alcon brakes).
   Action: Critical: Increase peak braking force by 15% at Turn 1/2 chicane. The GR86 race ABS allows 90-95% pressure without lock-up. Build confidence progressively.
   Potential Gain: 0.52-0.90s
   Estimated New Lap: 97.365s
   Confidence: High

2. [Full Throttle Utilization]
   Issue: Only 0.0% of lap at full throttle. GR86 requires 55%+ due to lower power output.
   Action: Critical: Reach 100% throttle 55% earlier. Focus on Turn 2 exit and Turn 5 exit. Every meter earlier = 0.05s gained on main straight.
   Potential Gain: 0.57-0.96s
   Estimated New Lap: 97.313s
   Confidence: High

3. [Throttle Application Timing]
   Issue: Throttle application 10.9% below best lap average.
   Action: Apply throttle at apex of Turn 3 and Turn 4. Target: 50% at apex, 75% at mid-exit, 100% at track-out. Current: 64.7%, Target: 75.6%.
   Potential Gain: 0.31-0.52s
   Estimated New Lap: 97.658s
   Confidence: High

4. [Throttle Consistency]
   Issue: Throttle variance of ±22.5% indicates inconsistent corner exits.
   Action: Standardize throttle application points. Use apex curbing as reference for initial 50% application. Smooth progression is critical.
   Potential Gain: 0.36-0.62s
   Estimated New Lap: 97.588s
   Confidence: High

5. [Average Speed Optimization]
   Issue: Average speed 12.4 km/h below your best lap (126.3 vs 138.7 km/h)
   Action: Focus on minimum corner speeds. Every 1 km/h gained through corners = 0.08s per lap. Target: 138.7 km/h average.
   Potential Gain: 5.78-8.66s
   Estimated New Lap: 90.859s
   Confidence: High

6. [Apex Consistency]
   Issue: Combined throttle (±22.5%) and speed (±21.0 km/h) variance indicates inconsistent apex positioning.
   Action: Standardize apex points at Turn 3 and Turn 4. Use inside curbing as reference. Consistent apex = consistent exit = consistent lap times.
   Potential Gain: 0.33-0.56s
   Estimated New Lap: 97.633s
   Confidence: High

7. [Corner Exit Acceleration]
   Issue: Exit acceleration of 0.02g is below GR86 potential.
   Action: Critical: Apply 50% throttle at Turn 2 apex, building to 100% by track-out. The GR86 requires aggressive exits to compensate for lower power. Every 0.1g improvement = 0.15s per lap.
   Potential Gain: 0.38-0.56s
   Estimated New Lap: 97.609s
   Confidence: High

8. [Cornering Speed Development]
   Issue: Lateral G-force of 0.17g is 0.83g below GR86 capability on slicks (1.0g threshold).
   Action: Critical: Increase corner entry speed by 5 km/h at Turn 3 and Turn 4. Build confidence progressively over 3 sessions. The GR86 on slicks can sustain 1.0g+ in steady-state cornering.
   Potential Gain: 0.38-0.60s
   Estimated New Lap: 97.591s
   Confidence: High

9. [Speed Gap to Leader]
   Issue: 10.5 km/h slower than fastest driver (Avg: 126.3 vs 115.8 km/h).
   Action: Study fastest driver's minimum corner speeds at Turn 3 and Turn 4. They carry 10.5 km/h more speed. Focus on entry positioning and mid-corner speed maintenance.
   Potential Gain: 0.50-0.75s
   Estimated New Lap: 97.450s
   Confidence: High

10. [Overall Consistency]
   Issue: Input variance (Speed: ±21.0 km/h, Throttle: ±22.5%) is the primary performance limiter.
   Action: Mandatory: Establish 3 reference points per corner - brake marker (100m board), turn-in point (apex curbing), throttle point (track-out). Consistency is the foundation of speed. All other improvements are meaningless without this.
   Potential Gain: 0.47-0.84s
   Estimated New Lap: 97.422s
   Confidence: High


================================================================================
MEDIUM PRIORITY (5 insights)
================================================================================

1. [Traction Management]
   Issue: Longitudinal acceleration of 0.02g is below GR86 capability on slicks.
   Action: The GR86 torque curve allows aggressive application from 3700 RPM. If losing traction at Turn 2 exit, reduce initial rate by 10%. If no traction loss, increase aggression by 20%.
   Potential Gain: 0.38-0.60s
   Estimated New Lap: 97.591s
   Confidence: Medium

2. [Speed Consistency]
   Issue: Speed varies by ±21.0 km/h - indicates inconsistent corner speeds
   Action: Use reference points for corner entry speeds. Aim for same speed at turn-in point every lap (±2 km/h tolerance).
   Potential Gain: 0.52-0.90s
   Estimated New Lap: 97.365s
   Confidence: Medium

3. [Maximum Speed Development]
   Issue: Top speed of 140.1 km/h suggests exit speed or straight-line issues
   Action: Focus on corner exit acceleration. Better exits = higher top speeds. Also check if you're short-shifting.
   Potential Gain: 0.30-0.60s
   Estimated New Lap: 97.628s
   Confidence: Medium

4. [Shift Point Optimization]
   Issue: Shifting at 6536 RPM. GR86 optimal shift point is 7100 RPM.
   Action: Shift 564 RPM later on main straight and Turn 2 exit. Use shift light as reference. Power curve remains strong to 7100 RPM.
   Potential Gain: 0.30-0.52s
   Estimated New Lap: 97.666s
   Confidence: Medium

5. [Input Smoothness]
   Issue: Abrupt input changes detected (Throttle: ±22.5%, Brake: ±1.8%).
   Action: Practice progressive inputs. Throttle: 0% to 100% over 1.5 seconds. Brake: 100% to 0% over 1.0 second. Smooth inputs = predictable car behavior.
   Potential Gain: 0.45-0.75s
   Estimated New Lap: 97.478s
   Confidence: Medium
